# Predicting-Mechanical-Properties-of-Basalt-Fibre-Reinforced-Concrete-using-Machine-Learning

Project Overview

This project develops predictive models using advanced machine learning techniques to estimate and optimize the mechanical properties of Basalt Fibre-Reinforced Concrete (BFRC). Traditional empirical methods for concrete mix design are often costly, time-consuming, and environmentally demanding. By integrating ML models like XGBoost, Random Forest, SVR, LightGBM, and CatBoost, this project aims to diminish the reliance on extensive physical testing, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of BFRC formulations.

Motivation

The motivation behind this research is to leverage machine learning to significantly reduce the empirical approach dependencies, thus expediting advancements in material design. This integration not only aims at enhancing the efficiency but also at promoting sustainable construction practices by minimizing waste and improving resource utilization.

Methodology

The project follows a structured approach:

Data Preprocessing: Standardization and cleaning to prepare data for modeling.
Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning: Systematic tuning of parameters for each model to find the optimal settings.
Validation and Testing: Employing cross-validation techniques to ensure the models' robustness and generalizability.
Feature Importance and SHAP Analysis: Investigating which features most significantly impact the mechanical properties of BFRC.
Genetic Algorithm: Integrating genetic algorithms to discover optimal concrete mix designs that conform to desired strength parameters.

Results

The project demonstrates that ML models can forecast the mechanical properties of BFRC with high accuracy. Through feature importance analysis and SHAP values, it provides deeper insights into the influential factors in BFRC properties. The genetic algorithm application further illustrates the potential to reduce trial and error in material selection.
