# Predicting-Mechanical-Properties-of-Basalt-Fibre-Reinforced-Concrete-using-Machine-Learning

Project Overview
This project applies advanced machine learning techniques to enhance the mechanical properties of Basalt Fiber-Reinforced Concrete (BFRC). By using algorithms such as XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, SVM, and CatBoost, predictive models were developed to accurately estimate the compressive, flexural, and tensile strengths of BFRC, aiming to optimize the material formulations used in construction.

Objectives
Predict Mechanical Properties: Utilize machine learning to predict compressive, flexural, and tensile strengths of BFRC.
Feature Importance Analysis: Apply SHAP values to understand the influence of various factors on BFRC's properties.
Optimization of Mixtures: Employ genetic algorithms to find optimal BFRC mix formulations that enhance performance and sustainability.
